# nodejs-mentoring

I've been live-streaming weekly to help people contribute to Node.js core.

Whether you're new to the project or looking to make deeper contributions, I will walk through real issues, PR reviews, and answer questions live.

You can also find support and mentoring on the official #nodejs-mentoring channels on Slack and Discord - Join through https://nodejs.org/en/about/get-involved.
